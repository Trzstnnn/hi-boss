            Dear Felicityyy,
        </p>
        
        <p class="valentine_message">
             I'm really sorry that this is my only surprise cttt. I actually had something else in mind, pero kinulang ako sa time to make it happen, so I did this instead. Perooo I promise I put a lot of effort into this! Even if it was just basic coding, ang hirap niya i-modify ha!! Perooooo worth it kung magugustuhan mo! ðŸ˜†<br>
            I know weâ€™re not exactly dating (yet?! ðŸ‘€), but I want you to know that I really, really like you. When I first started to have a crush on you (both way back in Grade 7 and earlier this year), I never thought it would grow into this. I didnâ€™t even expect you to like me back! You are the sweetest, cutest, and the prettiesttt, basta! You're just so beautiful, inside and out! <br>
            Iâ€™d love to spend more days with you as your friend (and maybe, someday, as your lover?! ðŸ‘€ðŸ¤¯) HAHAHAHA <br>
            Have a beautiful day, Cttt! <i>A day as beautiful as you! ðŸ’–âœ¨</i>
